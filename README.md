Smart Device usage analysis with SQL and Power BI

# Smart Device Usage Dashboard
This project analyzes user activity, calorie burn, and behavioral trends based on wearable device data.

## Business Task
Analyze smart device fitness data to identify usage trends and provide recommendations to improve Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.


## Tools Used:
- SQL (BigQuery)
- Power BI
- DAX

## Key Insights
- Peak activity hours: 6–8 PM
- Most users are categorized as sedentary
- Clear correlation between steps and calories burned

## Recommendations
- Send motivational app reminders during peak hours
- Launch beginner wellness programs
- Promote tracking features for low-activity users

## Potential Issues with the Data
- Small Sample Size (30 users) is	not representative of all users.
- Possible Bias	where data only from FitBit users, not all smart devices.
